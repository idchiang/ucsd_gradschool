## General notes
* If you use the templates (e.g. https://github.com/stevecheckoway/ucsddissertation or https://github.com/ucsd-thesis/ucsd-thesis), the review won't be a problem.
* When I write this document (2021), there aren't too many timeslots open for the reviews. Make your appointment ASAP.

## Preliminary review
* It takes ~30 min.
* You will need your dissertation draft. Set it ~2 weeks before your defense is a good idea since you should have your dissertation ready for your committee by that time.
* Preliminary review is not required before your defense. However, I would recoomend you do it before your defense for two 2 reasons: 1) if something went wrong, you have more time to fix them; 2) you might want to work on this meeting right after your defense...

## Final review
* If everything went well in the preliminary review, this meeting will be very brief.
* You should submit everything before this meeting. And this is the last requirement from the Graduate Division.
